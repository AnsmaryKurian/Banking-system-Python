# Banking system-Python
This is a simple command-line banking system written in Python. The system allows users to log in to their bank account and perform basic banking operations such as depositing money, withdrawing money, checking their balance, and viewing transaction history. The program uses an object-oriented approach with a BankAccount class to represent a user's account. This project is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate how basic banking operations can be simulated in Python.
Features:

    Account Login: Users must enter their password to access their account.
    Deposit Money: Users can deposit a specified amount into their account.
    Withdraw Money: Users can withdraw money, provided they have sufficient balance.
    Check Balance: Users can check their current account balance.
    Transaction History: Users can view a list of all deposits and withdrawals.

The system also includes error handling for invalid login attempts, invalid input amounts, and insufficient balance, providing a more user-friendly experience.
